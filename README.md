#  👀 2023 Solution Challenge - CHATBuddy 챗벗



## Problem
Due to the prolonged COVID-19, Korean youth mental health indicators have deteriorated. The problem with many people due to COVID-19 is that they are too often exposed to a society in which negative emotions such as anger, resentment and conflicts of hatred are prominent. Even if the current COVID-19 is stabilized, it is difficult to change daily life because it is fixed in an old life. <br/><br/>
  → Mental health facilities and manpower shortages for the vulnerable in the corona disaster <br/>
  → Koreans have a high psychological rejection of mental health services <br/>
  → financial burden on the price of mental health services <br/>
